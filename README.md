                                            C - Sorting Algorithms & Big O


About / Synopsis


This project is an introduction to implementing multiple sorting algorithms separately in the C programming language. Each sorting algorithm is implemented in a separate C file and is accompanied by a -O text file listing its time complexity.


Built With

Betty formatting

0-bubble_sort.c	

Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm, which repeatedly iterates through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

1-insertion_sort_list.c

Implements the Insertion Sort algorithm, which builds the final sorted array one item at a time, shifting elements that are greater than the current value to the right.

2-selection_sort.c

Implements the Selection Sort algorithm, which divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items yet to be sorted.

3-quick_sort.c

Implements the Quick Sort algorithm, a highly efficient sorting algorithm that divides the array into smaller sub-arrays based on a pivot element.
